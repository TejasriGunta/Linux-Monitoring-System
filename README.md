## Installation

### Prerequisites

**Linux / WSL (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev g++
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ ncurses-devel make
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel ncurses
```

### Build

```bash
cd activity_monitor
make clean
make -j2
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
./activity_monitor
```

### Command-Line Options
```bash
./activity_monitor [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -r <ms>         Set refresh rate in milliseconds (default: 1000)
  -t <threshold>  Set CPU alert threshold percentage (default: 80.0)
  -a              Disable high CPU alerts
  -d              Enable debug logging to activity_monitor_debug.log
  --help          Show help message
```

### Examples
```bash
# Fast refresh every 500ms
./activity_monitor -r 500

# Set CPU alert threshold to 90%
./activity_monitor -t 90

# Run without alerts
./activity_monitor -a

# Debug mode with logging
./activity_monitor -d
```

## WSL-Specific Notes

### Running in WSL
1. Open your WSL distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build and run inside WSL terminal (not PowerShell)

```bash
# From WSL terminal
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Desktop/OS_Project-trail2/activity_monitor
make
./activity_monitor
```

### Launching from PowerShell
```powershell
wsl ./activity_monitor
```

### Known Limitations in WSL
- **Temperature sensors**: `/sys/class/thermal` not available in WSL (removed from display)
- **Some hardware metrics**: Limited compared to native Linux
- **Terminal compatibility**: Use Windows Terminal or WSL-native terminal for best rendering

### Data Sources
- `/proc/stat` - CPU usage per core, context switches, interrupts
- `/proc/meminfo` - Memory and swap statistics
- `/proc/mounts` - Mounted filesystems
- `/proc/diskstats` - Disk I/O statistics (reads, writes, sectors, I/O ticks)
- `/proc/<pid>/stat` - Per-process CPU and memory
- `/proc/<pid>/status` - Process details
- `/proc/uptime` - System uptime
- `/proc/loadavg` - Load averages (1, 5, 15 min)

### Key Components
- **MonitorConfig**: Configuration struct for refresh rate, thresholds, options
- **CPUInfo**: Per-core and total CPU usage tracking
- **MemoryInfo**: Main memory and swap statistics
- **DiskInfo**: Per-filesystem usage information
- **DiskIOInfo**: Real-time disk I/O rates (MB/s, IOPS, busy%)
- **Process**: Per-process metrics (PID, name, CPU%, mem%)
- **SystemInfo**: Uptime, load average, system counters

## Technical Details

### CPU Monitoring
- Reads per-core statistics from `/proc/stat`
- Calculates delta between samples for accurate percentages
- Optional aggregation of logical cores into physical cores
- 120-sample rolling history for graph plotting
- **Stacked band visualization**: Each core (P0-P5) gets its own horizontal band with labeled separation
- Individual core variations visible within each band's range

### Memory Monitoring
- Dual-line graph with dynamic Y-axis scaling
- Tracks both main memory and swap separately
- Automatic scale adjustment to keep both lines visible
- Color-coded: cyan for main, yellow for swap

### Disk I/O Monitoring
- Reads from `/proc/diskstats` for all physical disks (excluding loop/ram/partitions)
- Calculates read/write rates in MB/s from sector deltas (512 bytes/sector)
- Tracks read/write operations per second (IOPS)
- Computes I/O busy percentage from I/O ticks
- Horizontal bar graphs scaled to maximum observed rate (minimum 10 MB/s scale)
- Color-coded busy percentage: green (<50%), yellow (<80%), red (‚â•80%)
- Separate bars for read (cyan) and write (red) operations

### Process Management
- Sorts by CPU or memory usage on demand
- Keyboard navigation with selection highlighting
- Kill with confirmation dialog
- Attempts SIGTERM first, then SIGKILL if needed
- Wait period configurable (default 500ms)

## Performance

- **Memory footprint**: ~5-10 MB typical
- **CPU overhead**: <1% on modern systems
- **Refresh rate**: Configurable, default 1000ms
- **History depth**: 120 samples per metric
- **Max processes displayed**: Adapts to terminal height

## Troubleshooting

### ncurses rendering issues
```bash
# Set TERM environment variable
export TERM=xterm-256color
./activity_monitor
```

### Permission errors for /proc
Run with appropriate permissions or check that /proc is mounted.

### Display corruption after exit
```bash
# Reset terminal
reset
# or
stty sane
```

### Graph not visible
- Ensure terminal is at least 80x24 characters
- Try resizing terminal window
- Check that terminal supports extended ASCII (ACS_BULLET, ACS_CKBOARD)
